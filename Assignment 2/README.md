# Assignment 2

## Note: 

- Programming Language - **Prolog**
- Documentation - Comments have been provided for important predicates and better readability. 

## Part A -

- Included files -
    1. **goal_stack.pl** - Goal Stack implementation
    2. **Test Cases** (Directory) - Test Cases given in Assignment Statement
- To run the prolog file use -
    1. prolog goal_stack.pl - Starts the program accept an initial state of blocks and outputs the steps for reaching a valid goal state.
- For easy reading of initial state, readFile predicate has been written which can be used to assert state variables.
- Valid goal state will only be solved by the program. Validation predicate has been written that validates a given goal state (Handles most invalid cases).
